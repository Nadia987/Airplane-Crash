# Airplane-Crash
The project Airplane Crash demonstrates the demolition of a building by an airplane using OpenGL’s concepts. The animation was created using OpenGL and C++. There are four elements: plane, road, sky and building. The OpenGL concept for creating complex objects like these are shown in this project. It shows the movement of an airplane from the runway to the collision with the building. The concepts used are pushmatrix(), translate(), popmatrix(), and timer function.

**User Requirement**
•	Easy to understand and should be simple.
•	The built in functions should be utilized to maximum extent.
•	OpenGL library facilities should be used.

**Software Requirement**
